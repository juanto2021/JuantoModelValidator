# MVM

This project is a extension of the USE Model Validator plug-in from Martin Gogolla, Fabian BÃ¼ttner, and Mark Richters 
for the UML-Based Specification Environment (http://useocl.sourceforge.net/w/index.php/Main_Page).
The code is developed in Java as an Eclipse plug-in. The output ".jar" file can be added as a plugin for USE v.0.
